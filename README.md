# spacetock-google-cloud-functions

API REST using Google Cloud Functions (Serverless)

## What we are going to build
1. Express API for CRUD services(create, read, update and delete) on a Firestore database.
2. Use Google Cloud Function to expose our Express server
3. Deploy our Google Cloud Function using Cloud CLI.

## Initializing project locally
```
$ npm install -g firebase-tools
```
Then, let's login into firebase account.
```
$ firebase login
........... input credentials
```

## Testing

Ready for deploying

$ firebase deploy
âœ”  Deploy complete!
